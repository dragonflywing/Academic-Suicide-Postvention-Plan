# Academic-Suicide-Postvention-Plan
Postvention is psychological first aid, crisis intervention, and other support offered after a suicide to affected individuals or the workplace as a whole to alleviate possible negative effects of the event. This repository is open access for any academic community to customize in preparation to respond compassionately following a suicide.

In 2013, there were four suicides in a single department at UC Berkeley, but the department failed to communicate with and support their community, resulting in untold trauma among survivors.  A series of future suicide attempts among graduate students occurred and ultimately one alumni completed suicide in 2018.  While Universities may have protocols following an affiliate death, these often fail to function in the way suicide postvention plans are meant to: as a means of suicide prevention and survivor support.  

Academic volunteers from Dragonfly Mental Health, a US based, globally operating nonprofit 501(c)(3), established a task force in 2020 to create an Academia-specific Suicide Postvention Plan Guide to augment University responses to suicide deaths and promote beneficial departmental level responses.  More than 30 global academics, many with lived experience of suicide loss or attempt survival, first gathered existing suicide postvention plan literature, guides, and templates.  They then deployed surveys to collect perspectives about responses that were helpful or hurtful.  An academia-specific plan was created, presented, implemented, and refined in collaboration with a departmental wellness committee at UC Berkeley.  

The guide advises on immediate, short-term and long-term responses a graduate department can take to compassionately and safely communicate to and support their community following a sudden or unexpected death.  This guide includes email templates and the purpose behind each step.  It includes a flow chart and an important contacts page and an upkeep section.  

Mood disorders which can lead to suicide are found at higher rates among graduate students.  Every academic community can now customize this suicide postvention plan. This is the first community-created, freely available, evidence-based suicide postvention plan created explicitly for academic and graduate student training communities.
