File 5_Letter to close-proximity individuals

Instructions: Those that are most affected by a suicide death should be reached out to as soon as possible to maximally support and protect them.  These may be their closest colleagues or friends within the department, classmates, lab mates, mentors and/or mentees.

2.	Resources to share 
3.	Email template if in-person connection isn’t possible/appropriate 

1. Guidance on reaching out 
- Reach out as soon as possible to any people that may be most deeply affected or impacted by the person’s death.  For example, if the person was a graduate student, this may include the supervisor of a lab if they worked in, a roommate if they are also in the department/program, lab mates (especially undergraduate or graduate mentees), or the classmates/cohort of the person.  

- If you can reach out to them in person to have this conversation one on one with, this is typically best in case there is a strong reaction.  

- Share resources, provide immediate support, and if there is a strong reaction, be prepared to spend extra time with them. Supportive actions to consider may include asking if they want to go for a walk or get a coffee, just being there as an active listener allowing them to take the time they need to process emotions or confusion out loud, or if very upset, offering to walk them to the psychological services or calling for immediate advice.  

- This process is often best in a processive fashion.  For example, if the deceased is a graduate student, having the department chair or another close faculty member on the suicide postvention team first reach out to the supervising faculty member of the lab within which the student worked. Once their needs are met, work with them to determine how best to tell and/or support the rest of the lab members. Once the lab mates are supported and connected with, determine with them which classmates may need special outreach and how best to reach out and provide support.

3. Email template for those that cannot be easily reached in person 

Dear [close proximity person, i.e. supervisor, classmates, lab mates, etc.], 

We have just been made aware about [deceased name] and we wanted to reach out to you directly to offer support to you and your [relevant community, i.e. lab, graduate cohort, office, etc.].  

If you would like to speak on the phone, please feel free to text or call me at [phone number] at any time.  

To give you an idea of what we'd like to discuss with you, here's a brief list: 

A. We wanted to check on you and see how you are doing and if there are any specific ways that we could help support you at this time?  

B. We want to find out more about your current [relevant community, i.e. lab, graduate cohort, office, etc.] make up and discuss the best way to reach out to anyone that is on campus now as well as those that may have known [deceased name] but are currently away (like other undergrads on summer vacation). Informing them all in a compassionate and direct fashion can be a challenging but important step. 

We also suggest arranging a group support session from [local psychological support people] as soon as possible for those currently on campus.  We are already in contact with folks at [local psychological support people] and would be happy to facilitate arranging that. If there's someone else in your lab such as a lab manager who you'd like us to speak and coordinate with, please feel free to connect them to us directly.  

C. Beginning the process of identifying those who we can support in arranging a memorial of some sort for [deceased name] will be very beneficial in assisting the grieving and healing process. The [your] department is prepared to assist in this.  

We are here for you as advocates and guides during this extremely difficult time.  This is precisely why we have a departmental suicide postvention plan and we are well prepared to support you, your [relevant community, i.e. lab, graduate cohort, office, etc.], and the entire department as best we can with evidence-based practices and compassion.  Please don't hesitate to lean on us.  

In community, 

[Name of Department Chairs or Suicide Postvention Team Lead]




Additional considerations and recommnedations: 

It is important to identify the most affected employees and collaborators from inside and outside the research institution:

- people working in physical proximity to the deceased (e.g. lab- or office-mates, teaching and research assistants, mentors and mentees, subgroup or team members, etc)

- people from outside the institution, working closely with the deceased (e.g. collaborators from other institutions, team members from non-scientific projects, such as community projects, etc.)

- to most effectively identify all affected outside the immediate department of the deceased, it might be of help to inquire around the lab or office about other initiatives or projects the person was a part of.

- people who reached out themselves and who were not identified by the PI or HR.
