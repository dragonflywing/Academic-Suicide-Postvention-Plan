File 3_Private Letter to family

This may only be used in response to a staff, faculty or postdoctoral fellow's death.  Undergraduate and graduate student's families are contacted only by the University crisis team on many campuses.  Determine your local campus policies and guidelines. 

Example summary: 
- There is no university body that will communicate with family of a staff, faculty or postdoctoral fellow's family following a death.  The department may contact them directly with condolences and request for their preferred wishes regarding privacy, memorials, and communication. 
- The department is encouraged to reach out to the family and if they need support in drafting compassionate communication, they may call the [LOCAL CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES] for support.  
- Prior to any memorial event, it is recommended to contact [LOCAL CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES], even if the event is co-organized with a campus crisis response team. Litigation may prevent some instances of memorializing, but most of the time holding a memorial event is fine. A detailed event itinerary may be recommended.
- There may be a difference with students and employees regarding MCB-organized support groups.
