1. Faculty Memo - long version 

Date: []

To: All faculty members of the [YOUR] Department 

From: [Name of Department Chair(s)] 

Re: Death of [Name of person] DO NOT FORWARD OR DISTRIBUTE

The [YOUR] Department is saddened to learn of the death of [Name of person]. The cause of death has not yet been determined. More information will be communicated at a later time. 

In the meantime, as we wait to learn about the family’s wishes regarding privacy and communication, please refrain from widely communicating about [Name of person]’s passing. 

The tragic and sudden circumstances of [Name of person]’s death may cause a range of reactions within our department, so we are sharing the following information and are offering support for those who might need it. 

Acutely Available Resources: (Optional at this stage if planned)  
Some of you may be having difficulty coping with the sudden loss of one of our department’s family. We have arranged for [NAME OF STUDENT PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT] and [NAME OF EMPLOYEE SUPPORT] professionals to facilitate a debriefing on [Date] at [Time] in [Location]. During this group meeting, counselors will be on hand to provide information about grief and psychological services available on campus and to answer any questions we may have. Others may prefer individual support at this time. If so, please utilize the resources we have compiled below.

Faculty and Department Specific Considerations: 
As faculty, please be aware that some members of the department may be at higher risk for psychological distress in response to news of a sudden death or suicide due to other factors (e.g. preexisting psychological conditions, especially mood disorders, history with suicide, those currently grieving others, etc.). If you are aware of these factors in colleagues or members of your lab, please ensure that they are checked on frequently by appropriate members of the community in coming days/weeks/months and ask if they would like support being connected to psychological services.  Ensure that additional support is provided as an option and not as a requirement. 

It is recommended to allow for alternative work schedules to be made available for those affected by the loss. People process loss differently, some might want to get straight back to work and others might need extra time. If possible, offer flexibility for working hours, remote work, etc. 

For those who have questions, [DESIGNATED POINT OF CONTACT IN DEPARTMENT] is available to talk to you. Please reach out to them via email at [POINT OF CONTACT'S EMAIL]. 

PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO OTHERS.  The Department will be communicating more information meant for others in the community shortly.  

If in the meantime, you would like to share resources with appropriate people, please copy and paste the information below and do so on an individual basis.
